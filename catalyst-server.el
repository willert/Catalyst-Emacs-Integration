;;; Commentary:

;; This is a pre-release version, nothing is stable at the moment,
;; although I am quite happy with using comint.el after a lot of
;; experimentation with other inferior interpreter or shell modes.
;; Most likely, I'll try to add a new major mode to allow for better
;; customization and add support for eproject.el by jrockway. Patches
;; and pull requests are always welcome :)

;;; Disclaimer:

;; I suck at elisp, so I can just hope the code is not too brain-damaged
